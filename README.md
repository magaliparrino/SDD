Some projects realized during my final year at SUPAERO, in the Data Science track.


### Anomaly detection project:
The goal was to detect anomalies from a dataset we had no information on.

### Hidden Markov Model project:
The goal was to create a a course notebook explaining a concept we had no prior knowledge on.
